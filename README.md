# CAM_FALL

## Project Details Clarification
**Background**
>According to the US CDC, falls are the leading cause of injury for adults ages 65 years and older. Over 14 million, or 1 in 4 older adults report falling every year.
Each year about $50 billion is spent on medical costs related to older adult falls.
A fall may cause Traumatic Brain Injury, which is fatal for older people. After falling, the time becomes more important to save lives. 
So it is necessary to save precious time for the professional aids.
Falls among adults aged 65 and older are common, costly, and preventable. How to make efforts to make falling unfatal and less expensive, which gives us motivation to find out.

**Project Plan**

The activities in this project are divided into two parts based on semesters.
> - During the first semester, the team will conduct software requirement analysis, design, architecture, documents, research report on audio processing and action classification. 
>
> - In the second semester, the team continues to complete the full development of the final product, perform software testing and write the quality assurance document and user manual.

## Project Goals
> <ol><li> Develop <strong>a robust fall detection algorithm</strong> using computer vision techniques for real-time analysis of camera footage.</li>
> <li> Implement <strong>audio localization capabilities</strong> to enhance fall detection accuracy and optimize camera positioning.</li>
> <li> Integrate <strong>pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) functionality to dynamically adjust the camera's orientation</strong> towards the detected fall location.</li>
> <li> Design an alert system to promptly <strong>notify caregivers or emergency contacts</strong> upon fall detection, accompanied by video footage for further assessment.</li>
> <li> Ensure <strong>user-friendly adaptability</strong> to various home environments, considering factors such as lighting conditions and camera placement.</li></ol>

## Technical Details
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
> 1. Primary programming languages include Python, with the utilization of OpenCV libraries for computer vision tasks.	
> 2. Implementation of audio processing techniques to localize sound sources and aid in fall detection.	
> 3. Hardware components encompass IP cameras featuring PTZ capabilities and microphones for audio capture.
> 4. The system architecture is designed to operate on either a local server or a cloud platform, contingent on scalability and resource demands. 


## Communication &  meetings
- <strong>With Client</strong>: Weekly two main meetings, Monday/Friday, Zoom/WeChat.
- <strong>With team members</strong>: Monday/Friday, Zoom.
- <strong>With tutor and shadow team</strong>:  Wednesday 14:00 - 16:00, In Person On Campus.

## Team Decision Making
The endorsement of a proposal hinges on securing the majority support of the team. Should there be an equal division of opinions, 
the determination should focus on what most benefits the project, involving further dialogue with relevant stakeholders, especially the client, to ensure an informed decision.

## Ground Rules
>Part 1: Task Assignment and Execution
Assign tasks weekly, aligning with members' skills and interests.
Members must complete tasks punctually and maintain quality.
Encourage proactive communication and timely problem-reporting among team members.
Attend and actively engage in weekly meetings, sharing ideas and progress.

>Part 2: Meeting Conduct and Collaboration
Address conflicts through mutual understanding.
Respect and open dialogue among members are crucial.
Record meetings for reference.
Allow absence or workload reduction for ill members; provide extensions for technical difficulties.

>Part 3: Communication Protocols
Respond to project communications within 24 hours.
Be reachable from 5 pm to midnight for urgent matters.

>Part 4: Work Distribution
Allocate and reassess tasks in weekly meetings.
Subgroup coordinators manage and verify task completion.
Promptly communicate any work-related challenges.

>Part 5: Performance Evaluation
Evaluate based on time investment and various contributions.
Allow subjective assessments if justifiable.
Utilize sprint story points for performance tracking and future planning.

## Conflict Resolutions
In the event of a significant dispute, these measures should be implemented for resolution:

>Scheduling a Discussion: Coordinate a meeting time to address the issue collaboratively with involved team members.

>Active Listening: Pay close attention to each team member's perspective, ensuring not to cut off anyone while they are speaking.

>Identifying Common Ground and Differences: Ascertain areas where opinions converge and diverge. Prioritize the conflicts that are crucial to resolve and focus the discussion around these points.

>Formulating a Resolution Strategy: Craft a detailed strategy to tackle each identified conflict, assigning clear responsibilities and deadlines to ensure follow-through.

>Fostering a Cooperative Spirit: Embrace a cooperative mindset throughout the process, encouraging all members to adopt a problem-solving approach that emphasizes teamwork and collective success.

>Encouraging Open Communication: Promote an environment where all team members feel comfortable voicing their opinions and concerns, facilitating a more inclusive and comprehensive conflict resolution process.

>Ongoing Monitoring and Adaptation: Regularly review the progress of the conflict resolution plan, being prepared to make adjustments as necessary to ensure the conflict is moving towards a satisfactory resolution.
